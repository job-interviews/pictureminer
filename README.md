Yet another Android Flickr gallery. This task was asked to be made for a job interview.

## Idea

A gallery of flickr images using the open-source Flickr API. You can:

* Save the image offline
* Preview the image in the system gallery
* Share it in an email
* Order by date taken or date published

## Technologies & Libs

The app is built using:

* Dagger 2
* Retrofit
* RxJava 2
* MVP
* Timber
* LeakCanary
* Picasso
* PermissionsDispatcher

## Things missing

* Crash reporting library
* Better design & icon
* Network connection handling - a UI for offline mode
* Probably many other options
